# Click Link plugin

This plugin allows the management of links and events on the Jeedom interface. You will be able for example with this one to create an order which opens a modal (dialog window) with a view containing your cameras. This allows for example when someone rings at your home to directly display the entry camera on your Jeedom.

# Plugin configuration

After downloading the plugin, you just need to activate it, there is no configuration at this level.
